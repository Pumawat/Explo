Release 2.8.6
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Trying to build an atomic R vector from a Python object that has a length,
  but it not a sequence nor an iterator was causing a segfault (issue #407 -
  backport from rpy2-2.9.0).

- Passing parameters names that are empty string to R function was
  causing a segfault (issue #409 - backport from rpy2-2.9.0).


Release 2.8.5
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- The defintion of the method :class:`rpy2.rlike.container.OrdDict.items`
  was incorrect, and so was the documentation for `rcall` (issue #383)
  
- Giving an empty sequence to :meth:`robjects.sequence_to_vector` is now
  raising a :class:`ValueError` rather than fail with an
  :class:`UnboundLocalError` (see issue #388).

- :meth:`robjects.robject.RSlots.items` is now working (see pull request #57).


Release 2.8.4
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- The context manager :func:`rpy2.robjects.lib.grdevices.render_to_file`
  is no longer trying to impose a file name generated by :mod:`tempfile`
  (issue #371)

- The symbol `LISTSXP` (corresponding to R pairlist objects) was not
  imported from the C module in rpy2.
  
- The functions `scale_linetype_discrete` and `scale_linetype_continuous`
  in ggplot2 were not wrapped by :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.ggplot2`
  (issue #381)


Release 2.8.3
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Fixed the error when the transformation of R "man" pages into Python
  docstrings was failing when the section "arguments" was missing
  (issue #368)
  
- Failing to find R in the PATH during the installation of rpy2
  is now printing an error message instead of a warning (issue #366)
  
  
Release 2.8.2
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- R's `dplyr::src_dt` was moved to `dtdplyr::src_dt` with `dplyr` release 0.5.0.
  To address this, `src_dt` will become a `None` if the R package `dplyr` is
  discovered to be of version >= 0.5.0 at runtime. (issue #357)

- Conversion issue when R symbols were accessed as attribute of the singleton
  :class:`rpy2.robjects.R`. (issue #334)

- The `rmagic` extension for `ipython` was no longer loading with the latest
  ipython (version 5.0.0). (issue #359)
  
Changes
-------

- The fix to issue #357 (see bugs fixed above) was expanded to cover all
  R packages wrapped in :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib` and ensure that the respective
  Python modules can loaded even if symbols are no longer defined in future
  versions of the corresponding R packages.


Release 2.8.1
=============

New features
------------

- `Dockerfile` with automated build on dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com/r/rpy2/rpy2)

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Trying to install rpy2 while R is not in the `PATH` resulted in an error
  in `setup.py`.


Release 2.8.0
=============

New features
------------

- New class :class:`rpy2.robjects.SourceCode`. The class extends Python's
  :class:`str` and is meant to represent R source code. An HTML
  renderer for the ipython notebook (syntax highlighting using
  :mod:`pygment` is also added).
  
- New module :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.tidyr` providing a custom
  wrapper for the R library `tidyr`

- The long-deprecated functions :func:`rpy2.rinterface.set_writeconsole` and
  :func:`rpy2.rinterface.get_writeconsole` are no longer available. One of
  :func:`rpy2.rinterface.set_writeconsole_regular` / :func:`rpy2.rinterface.set_writeconsole_warnerror`
  or :func:`rpy2.rinterface.get_writeconsole_regular` / :func:`rpy2.rinterface.get_writeconsole_warnerror`
  respectively should be used instead.
  
- The attribute :attr:`rpy2.robjects.RObject.slots` can now be implictly interated on
  (the method :meth:`__iter__` is now an alias for :meth:`keys`).

- The default Python-R conversion is now handling functions. This means that
  Python function can directly be used as parameters to R functions (when
  relevant).

- Ipython display hook `display_png` for ggplot2 graphics.

- :mod:`pandas` "category" vectors are better handled by the pandas conversion.

- New module :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.grdevices` providing a custom
  wrapper for the R library 'grDevices', exposing few key functions in
  the package and providing context managers (`render_to_file` and
  `render_to_bytesio`) designed to simplify the handling of static plots
  (e.g., webserver producing graphics on the fly or figure embedded in a
  Jupyter notebook).

- Numpy conversion is handling better arrays with `dtype` equal to `"O"`
  when all objects are either all inheriting from :class:`str` or from
  :class:`bytes`. Such arrays are now producing :class:`StrSexpVector` or
  :class:`BytesSexpVector` objects respectively.
  
- R's own printing of warnings if now transformed to warnings of type
  `rinterface.RRuntimeWarning` (it used to be a regular `UserWarning`)

- The family of functions `src_*` and the function `tbl` in the R package
  `dplyr` have aliases in the module :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr`, and
  a class :class:`DataSource` has been added for convenience.

- :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.DataFrame` has a method `head` corresponding
  to R's method of the same name. The method takes the n first row of a
  data frame.

- dplyr's functions `count_` and `tally` are now exposed as methods for
  the class :class:`dplyr.DataFrame`.

Changes
-------

- Building/installing rpy2 with a development version of R does not require
  the use of option `--ignore-check-rversion` any longer. A warning is
  simply issue when the R version is "development".

- On MSWindows, the dependency on `pywin32` was removed (issue #315)

- :class:`GroupedDataFrame` in the dplyr interface module is now inheriting
  from the definition of DataFrame in that same module (it was previously
  inheriting from :class:`robjects.vectors.DataFrame`).

- The default `repr()` for R objects is now printing the R classes
  (as suggested in issue #349).

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Parameter names to R function that are in UTF-8 are no longer causing a
  segfault (issue #332)
  
- Looking for a missing key in an R environment (using `__getitem__` or `[`)
  could raise a `LookupError` instead of a `KeyError`.

- R environment can now handle unicode keys as UTF-8 (was previously
  trying Latin1)

- rpy2 is interrupting attempts to install with Python < 2.7 with an
  informative error message (issue #338)

- Setting the R class can be done by using a simple Python string (issue #341)

- `rpy2.robjects.lib.grid.viewport` is now returning an instance of class
  `Viewport` (defined in the same module) (issue #350)
  

Release 2.7.9
=============

Bug fixed
---------

- Python objects exposed to R could lead to segfault when the Python process is
  exiting (issue #331)


Release 2.7.8
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- American English spelling was missing for some of the function names
  to specify colour (color) scales.
  
- Fix for printing R objects on Windows (pull request #47)


Release 2.7.7
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Pickling `robjects`-level objects resulted in `rinterface`-level objects
  when unpickled (issue #324).


Release 2.7.6
=============
 
Changes
-------

- :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.ggplot2` was modified to match the newly released
  ggplot2-2.0.0. This is introducing API-breaking changes, which breaks the
  promise to keep the API stable through bugfix releases within series, but
  without it 2.7.x will not a work with new default installation of the R
  package ggplot2.


Release 2.7.5
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Division and floordivision through the delegator `.ro` provided with
  R vectors wrapped by `robjects`. (issue #320)

- Memory leak when unserializing (unpickling) R objects bundled in Python
  objects (issue #321)
  

Release 2.7.4
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Python 3.5 highlighted slightly incorrect C-level flags in rpy2 objects
  declarations, and :mod:`rpy2.robjects` could not be imported.
  
- Fixed unit tests for rmagic when :mod:`numpy` is not installed, and
  for :mod:`numpy` is installed by :mod:`pandas` in missing.


Release 2.7.3
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- method :meth:`DataFrame.collect` in :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr`
  was not functioning.

- Applied patch by Matthias Klose to fix implict pointer conversions.

- :mod:`pandas2ri.ri2py_dataframe` is now propagating the row names
  in the R data frame into an index in the pandas data frame (issue #285)

- methods `union`, `intersect`, `setdiff`, `ungroup` defined in the R package
  `dplyr` were missing from the
  `DataFrame` definition in :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr`


Release 2.7.2
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- methods `distinct`, `sample_n`, and `sample_frac` defined in the R package
  `dplyr` were missing from the `DataFrame` definition in
  :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr`

- The fix for the inheritance problem with
  :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr.DataFrame` introduced a regression whenever
  `group_by` is used.

- The methods to perform joins on dplyr `DataFrame` objects where not
  working properly.


Release 2.7.1
=============
 
Bugs fixed
----------

- The :meth:`__repr__` for :mod:`robjects`-level vectors
  was broken for vectors of length 1 (issue #306)

- The ipython notebook-based sections of the documentation
  were not building

- Classes inheriting from :mod:`dplyr.DataFrame` had dplyr methods
  returning objects of their parent class.

Release 2.7.0
=============

New features
------------

- New exception :class:`rpy2.rinterface.RParsingError`. Errors
  occurring when parsing R code through :func:`rpy2.rinterface.parse`
  raise this exception (previously :class:`rpy2.rinterface.RRuntimeError`).

- New class :class:`rpy2.robjects.conversion.Converter` to replace
  the `namedtuple` of the same name

- New class :class:`rpy2.robjects.converter.ConversionContext`. This is
  a context manager allowing an easy setting of local conversion rules.
  The constructor has an alias called
  :meth:`rpy2.robjects.constructor.localconverter`.

- New module :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.dplyr` providing a custom
  wrapper for the R library `dplyr`

- Method :method:`Environment.items()` to iterate through the symbols
  and associated objects in an R environment.

- Exception :class:`rpy2.rinterface.ParsingIncompleError`, a child class of
  :class:`rpy2.rinterface.ParsingError`, raised when
  calling :meth:`rpy2.rinteface.parse` results in R's C-level status
  to be `PARSE_INCOMPLETE`. This can make the Python implementation of an
  IDE for R easier.
  
- Attribute :attr:`slots` for :mod:`rpy2.robjects`-level objects. The
  attribute is a :class:`rpy2.robjects.Rslots` which
  behaves like a Python mapping to provide access to R-attributes
  for the object (see issue #275).

- The R "magic" for ipython `%%R` can be passed a local converter
  (see new features above) by using `-c`.


Bugs fixed
----------

- Conversion rules were not applied when parsing and evaluating string
  as R with :class:`rpy2.robjects.R`.

- Calling the constructor for :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.FactorVector`
  with an R factor is no longer making a copy, loosing the associated
  R attributes if any (fixes issue #299).

- `rpy2` could crash when R was unable to dynamically load the C extension for
  one of its packages (noticed with issue #303).
  

Changes
-------

- :func:`rpy2.rinterface.is_initialized` is now a function.

- :meth:`rpy2.robjects.R.__call__` is now calling R's `base::parse()`
  to parse the string rather the parser through R's C-API. The workaround
  let's us retrieve R's error message in case of failure (see issue #300)


Release 2.6.3
=============

Bug fixed
---------

- Metaclass `RS4Auto_Type` facilitating the creation of Python
  classes from R S4 classes was not handling classes without
  methods (issue #301)


Release 2.6.2
=============

Bugs fixed
----------
 
- Check that R >= 3.2 is used at build time (issue #291)

- Conversion rules were not applied when parsing and evaluating string
  as R code with :class:`rpy2.robjects.R`.


Release 2.6.1
=============

New features
------------

- Because of their long names, the classes
  :class:`SignatureTranslatedAnonymousPackage`,
  :class:`SignatureTranslatedPackage`, and
  :class:`SignatureTranslatedFunction`
  in :mod:`rpy2.robjects.packages` have now the aliases
  :class:`STAP`, :class:`STP`, and :class:`STF` respectively.

Bugs fixed
----------

- Typo in function name emitting warnings at build time (issue #283)
 
- The conversion of `TaggedList` instances is now handling the names
  of items in the list (issue #286)


Changes
-------

- Loading the `ipython` extension in the absence of `pandas` or `numpy`
  is now issuing a warning (issue #279)
  
  
Release 2.6.0
=============

New features
------------

- Report the existence during build time of a file `.Renviron`,
  or the definition of the environment variables `R_ENVIRON' or
  `R_ENVIRON_USER` with a warning. (issue #204)

- Moved console writting callback to use `ptr_R_WriteConsoleEx`
  rather than `ptr_R_WriteConsole`. This allows callbacks
  for warnings and messages. `get/set_writeconsole` is now 
  replaced by `get/set_writeconsole_regular` (regular
  output) and `get/set_writeconsole_warnerror` (warning and error).
  In order to conserve backward compatibility an alias for
  `get/set_writeconsole_regular` called `get/set_writeconsole` is
  provided.

- Added callback for `ptr_R_ResetConsole`.

- :mod:`pandas` :class:`Categorical` objects are automatically handled
  in the pandas converter.

- The translation of R symbols into Python symbols used in `importr` and
  underlying classes and methods can be customized with a callback.
  The default translation turning `.` into `_` is `default_symbol_r2python`.

- Translation of named arguments in R function is now sharing code with the
  translation of R symbols (see point above), providing a consistent way to
  perform translations.

- Utility function `sequence_to_vector` in `robjects` to convert Python
  sequences (e.g., `list` or `tuple`) to R vector without having to
  specify the type (the type is inferred from the list).

- :mod:`robjects.vectors` object have a property :attr:`NAvalue` that contains
  the `NA` value for the vector, allowing generic code on R vectors.
  For example, testing whether any vector contains `NA` can be written as
  `any(x is myvector.NAvalue for x in myvector)`. Making numpy /masked/ array
  is an other application.

Changes
-------

- The automatic name translation from R to Python used in `importr` is
  now slightly more complex. It will not only translate `.` to `_` but
  should a conflict arise from the existence in R of both the `.` and `_`
  versions the `.` version will be appended a `_` (in accordance with
  :pep:0008). The change was discussed in issue #274).

- The ipython 'R magic' is now starting with a default conversion mode
  that is `pandas2ri` if it can find it, then `numpy2ri` if it can find it,
  and then the basic conversion.

- R vectors are now typed at the C level (IntSexpVector, FloatSexpVector,
  ListSexpVector, etc...) whenever retrieving them from the embedded R
  with the low-level `rinterface`. This is facilitating dispatch on vector
  type (e.g., with `singledispatch` now used for the conversion system).
  
Bugs fixed
----------

- The evaluation of R code through R's C-level function `tryEval`
  caused console output whenever an error occurred. Moving to
  the seemingly experimental `tryEvalSilent` makes evaluations less
  verbose.

- Multiple plots in one ipython cell (pull request #44)

Release 2.5.7
=============

- `simplegeneric` was moved of ipython 4.0.0 (pull request #43)


Release 2.5.6
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Detection of the R version during setup on Win8 (issues #255 and #258)

- Segmentation fault when converting :mod:`pandas` :class:`Series` with
  elements of type object (issue #264)

- The default converter from Python (non-rpy2) objects to rinterface-level
  objects was producing robjects-level objects whenever the input was of
  type :class:`list` (discovered while fixing issue #264)

- Implemented suggested fix for issue with unlinking files on Windows
  (issue #191)

- Testing rpy2 in the absence of ipython no longer stops with an error
  (issue #266)


Release 2.5.5
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Crash (segfault) when querying an R object in an R environment triggers an
  error (symbol exists, but associated values resolves to an error - issue #251)

- Change in the signature of `rcall` was not updated in the documentation
  (issue #259)

- Minor update to the documentation (issue #257)


Release 2.5.4
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Filter PNG files on size, preventing empty files causing trouble to be
  ipython notebook rendering of graphics later on (slight modification of
  the pull request #39)

- Fix installation left unresolved with rpy2-2.5.3 (issue #248)

- Possible segfault with Python 3.4 (issue #249)


Release 2.5.3
=============

Changes
-------

- `setup.py` has `install_requires` in addition to `requires` in the hope to
   fix the missing dependency with Python 2 (:mod:`singledispatch` is required
   but not installed).

Bugs fixed
----------

- Extracting configuration information from should now work when R is emitting a warning (issue #247) 

- On OS X the library discovery step can yield nothing (see issue #246). A tentative fix is to issue
  a warning and keep moving.


Release 2.5.2
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- String representation of :class:`robjects.R` (issue #238)

- Check during `build_ext` if unsupported version of R (pull request #32)

- HTMl display of columns of factors in a DataFrame (issue #236)

- HTML display of factors (issue #242)


Release 2.5.1
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Require singledispatch if Python 3.3 (issue #232)

- Fixed bug when R spits out a warning when asked configuration information (issue #233)

- Restored printing of compilation information when running `setup.py`

- Fixed installation issue on some systems (issue #234)

- Workaround obscure failure message from unittest if Python < 3.4 and
  :mod:`singledispatch` cannot be imported (issue #235)


Release 2.5.0
=============

New features
------------

- Experimental alternative way to preserve R objects from garbage collection.
  This can be activated with `rinterface.initr(r_preservehash=True)` (default
  is `False`.

- :class:`GGPlot` object getting a method :meth:`save`
  mirroring R's `ggplot2::ggsave()`.

- The conversion system is now using generics/single dispatch.

- New module :mod:`rpy2.ipython.html` with HTML display for rpy2 objects

- [Experimental] New function :func:`robjects.methods.rs4instance_factory`
  to type RS4 objects with more specificity.

Changes
-------

- The script `setup.py` was rewritten for clarity and ease of maintenance.
  Now it only uses `setuptools`.


Release 2.4.4
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Use `input` rather than `raw_input` in the default console callback
  with Python 3 (fixes issue #222)

- Issues with conversions, pandas, and rmagic (fixes issue #218 and more)


Release 2.4.3
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- `geom_raster` was missing from `rpy2.robjects.lib.ggplot2` (pull request #30)

- Fixed issue with SVG rendering in ipython notebook (issue #217)

- Regression with `rx2()` introduced with new conversion (issue #219)

- Fixed documentation (missing `import`) (issue #213)


Release 2.4.2
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Assigning an R `DataFrame` into an environment was failing if
  the conversion for Pandas was activated. (Issue #207)


Release 2.4.1
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- :meth:`rpy2.ipython` fixed spurious output to notebook cells.



Release 2.4.0
=============

Changes
-------

- Conversion system slightly changed, with the optional
  conversions for :mod:`numpy` and :mod:`pandas` modified
  accordingly. The changes should only matter if using
  third-party conversion functions.
 
- The Python 3 version is now a first class citizen. `2to3`
  is no longer used, and the code base is made directly
  compatible with Python. This lowers significantly the
  installation time with Python 3 
  (which matters when developping rpy2).

- The default options to initialize R (`rpy2.rinterface.initoptions') are no longer
  `('rpy2', '--quiet', '--vanilla', '--no-save')` but now
  `('rpy2', '--quiet', '--no-save')`.

- :class:`robjects.vectors.ListVector` can be instanciated from
  any objects with a method `items()` with the expectation that the method
  returns an iterable of (name, value) tuples, or even be an iterable
  of (name, value) tuples.

New features
------------

- For instances of :class:`rpy2.robjects.Function`,
  the `__doc__` is now a property fetching information
  about the parameters in the R signature.

- Convenience function :func:`rpy2.robjects.packages.data`
  to extract the datasets in an R pacakges

- :mod:`ipython`'s `rmagic` is now part of :mod:`rpy`. To use, `%load_ext
  rpy2.ipython` from within IPython.

- new method :meth:`rpy2.rinterface.SexpEnvironment.keys`, returnings
  the names in the environment as a tuple of Python strings.

- convenience class :class:`robjects.packages.InstalledPackages`, with a companion function
  :func:`robjects.packages.isinstalled`.

- new class :class:`rinterface.SexpSymbol` to represent R symbols

Bugs fixed
----------

- :meth:`rpy2.rinterface.Sexp.do_slot` was crashing when
  the parameter was an empty string (PR #155)



Release 2.3.10
==============

Bugs fixed
----------

- `setup.py build` was broken when new R compiled with OpenMP (Issue #183)

Release 2.3.9
=============

- Changes in pandas 0.13.0 broke the rpy2 conversion layer (Issue #173)


Release 2.3.8
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Crash with R-3.0.2. Changes in R-3.0.2's C API coupled to a strange behaviour
  with R promises caused the problem. (PR #150)


Release 2.3.7
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- ggplot2's "guides" were missing

- ggplot2's "theme_classic" was missing (PR #143)

- ggplot2's "element_rect" was missing (PR #144)

- :func:`rpy2.interactive.packages` was broken (PR #142)


Release 2.3.6
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Several reports of segfault on OS X (since rpy2-2.3.1 - PR #109)

- More fixes in converting `DataFrames` with dates from `pandas`


Relase 2.3.5
============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Missing mapping to ggplot2's `scale_shape_discrete` function

- Better handling of dates in Pandas

- Constructor for POSIXct improved (and fixed)

Changes
-------

- The attribute :attr:`rclass` is no longer read-only and can be set
  (since R allows it)

- Importing the module :mod:`rpy2.interactive` no longer activates
  event processing by default (triggering concurrency errors
  when used with ipython).

New features
------------

- New module :mod:`rpy2.interactive.ipython` (so far plotting
  automatically a ggplot2 figure in the iPython's console)

- It is now possible to set the :attr:`rclass`.


Relase 2.3.4
============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Spurious error when running unit tests with Python 3 and numpy
  installed

- Missing mapping to ggplot2's `geom_dotplot` function

- Warnings are not longer printed (see Changes below)

Changes
-------

- Bumped target version of ggplot2 to 0.9.3.1

- Warnings are not longer printed. The C-level function in R became
  hidden in R-3.0, and the cost of an R-level check/print is relatively
  high if the R code called is very short. This might evolve into
  printing warnings only if interactive mode in Python (if this can
  be checked reliably).


Release 2.3.3
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Some of the data.frames converted from :mod:`pandas` were triggering
  a :class:`TypeError` when calling :func:`repr`

- In :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.ggplot2`, a mapping to `coord_fixed` was
  missing (PR #120)

- Using the parameter `lib_loc` in a call to
  :func:`rpy2.robjects.packages.importr` was resulting in an error (PR #119)

- Creating a `layer` through the `rpy2.robjects.lib.ggplot2` interface did
  not accept parameters (PR #122)

- Testing the Python version was crashing of a number of unsupported Python
  versions (<= 2.6) (PR #117)

New features
------------

- New module pandas2ri to convert from mod:`pandas` `DataFrame` objects

- New classes :class:`rpy2.robjects.lib.grid.Unit` and
  :class:`rpy2.robjects.lib.grid.Gpar` to model their counterparts in
  R's `grid` package as they were previously missing from rpy2.


Release 2.3.2
=============

Bug fixed
---------

- Building on Win64 (pull request #6)

- Fetching data from an R package through `importr` was masking
  any R object called `data` in that package. The data are now
  under the attribute name `__rdata__`. This is not completely
  safe either, although much less likely, a warning will
  be issued if still masking anything.
  

Changes
-------

- More informative error message when failing to build because `R CMD config`
  does not return what is expected

Release 2.3.1
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- default console print callback with Python (issue #112 linked to it)

- deprecation warnings with ggplot2 (issue #111 and contributed patch)



Release 2.3.0
=============

New Features
------------

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- C-level API, allowing other C-level modules to make use of utilities
  without going through the Python level. The exact definition of
  the API is not yet fixed. For now there is 
  PyRinteractive_IsInitialized() to assess whether R was initialized
  (through :mod:`rpy2.rinterface` or not).

- C-module _rpy_device, allowing one to implement R graphical devices
  in Python [(very) experimental]

- Tracking of R objects kept protected from garbage collection by rpy2
  is now possible.

- New method :meth:`Sexp.rid` to return the identifier of the R object
  represented by a Python/rpy2 object

:mod:`rpy2.rinteractive`:

- Dynamic build of Python docstrings out of the R manual pages

:mod:`rpy2.robjects.help`:

- Build dynamic help

:mod:`rpy2.robjects.packages`:

- Build anonymous R packages from strings

- When using :func:`importr`, the datasets are added as an attribute
  :attr:`data`, itself an instance of a new class :class:`PackageData`.
  It no longer possible to access datasets are regular objects from

=============

New Features
------------

- Support for Python 3, and for some of its features ported to Python 2.7

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- :meth:`Environment.keys` to list the keys

- classes :class:`robjects.vectors.POSIXlt` and 
  :class:`robjects.vectors.POSIXlt` to represent vectors of R

  automatically R S4 classes as Python classes.

- :meth:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.FactorVector.iter_labels` to iterate over the labels

- :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.ListVector` to represent R lists.

- Constructor for :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.ListVector` and 
  :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.DataFrame` accept any iterable at the condition
  that the elements iterated through also valid subscripts for it (e.g., given
  an iterable v, the following is valid:

  .. code-block:: python

     x[k] for x in v


:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- :data:`NA_Complex` and :class:`NAComplexType` for missing complex values.

- :class:`SexpExtPtr` to represent R objects of type EXTPTR (external pointers).

- :func:`rpy2.rinterface.rternalise` to wrap Python function as :class:`SexpClosure` that can
  be called by R just as it was a function of its own.

- :class:`rpy2.rinterface.RNULLType` for R's C-level NULL value and 
  :class:`rpy2.rinterface.UnboundValueType` for R's C-level R_UnboundValue
  (both singletons).

- :meth:`rinterface.SexpVector.index`, of similar behaviour to :meth:`list.index`.

- :meth:`rpy2.rinterface.Sexp.list_attrs` to list the names of all R attributes
  for a given object.

- :class:`rpy2.rinterface.ByteSexpVector` to represent R 'raw' vectors.

- constant `R_LEN_T_MAX` to store what is the maximum length for a vector in R.

:mod:`rpy2.rlike`:

- :class:`container.OrdDict` get proper methods :meth:`keys` and `get`

:mod:`rpy2.interactive`:

- A new sub-package to provide utilities for interactive work, either for
  handling R interactive events or use Python for interactive programming
  (as often done with the R console)

Changes
-------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- NA_bool, NA_real, NA_integer, NA_character and NA_complex are now
  deprecated (and removed).
  NA_Logical, NA_Real, NA_Integer, NA_Character, NA_Complex should be used.

  to active the conversion. Explicit activation is now needed; the function
  `activate` can do that.


:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- :class:`IntSexpVector`, :class:`FloatSexpVector`,
  :class:`StrSexpVector`, :class:`BoolSexpVector`, :class:`ComplexSexpVector`

  from :class:`RS4`

- :class:`RS4_Type` for metaclass-declared accessors

- Delegating classes :class:`ExtractDelegator` and 
  :class:`DoubleExtractDelegator` for extracting the R-way

- :class:`DataFrame` (formerly *RDataFrame*) can now be created 
  from :`rlike.container.OrdDict`
  instances, or any other object inheriting from dict.

- :class:`FactorVector` to represent R factors

- the conversion is now returning subclasses of
  :class:`robjects.vectors.Vector` -formerly *RVector*-
  (such as :class:`IntVector`, 
  :class:`FloatVector`, etc...) rather than only return :class:`Vector`

- :class:`StrVector` has a method :meth:`factor` to turn a
  vector of strings into an R factor

- Initial commit of a callback-based implementation of an R graphical device
  (this is for the moment very experimental - and not fully working)

- :meth:`SexpClosure.rcall` is now taking 2 parameters, 
  a tuple with the parameters and
  an :class:`SexpEnvironment` in which the call is to be evaluated.

  :class:`double`, :class:`bool`, and :class:`None` 
  in a call (using :class:`SexpClosure`) are now automatically converted
  to length-one R vectors (at the exception of None, converted
  to R_NilValue).

- Python slices can now be used on R vector-like objects

  and :class:`TaggedList`

- static method :meth:`from_iteritems` for :class:`TaggedList`,
  for creating a TaggedList from any object having a method :meth:`iteritems`

  R library-related paths are wished. python setup.py --help build_ext will
  list them
  
:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- RS4 no longer makes R's slots as Python attributes through :meth:`__attr__`

- The package is split into modules

- The broken variables NA_STRING, NA_INTEGER, NA_LOGICAL, and NA_REAL are
  removed. The documentation on missing values was revised.

- :data:`globalEnv` and :data:`baseNameSpaceEnv` were renamed to 
  :data:`globalenv` and :data:`baseenv` respectively

- The parameter *wantFun* in :meth:`Environment.get` 
  (formerly *REnvironment.get()*) is now *wantfun* 

- :attr:`Vector.r` does not have a __getitem__ method any longer
  (see in `.rx` and `.rx2` in the new features)

  for :class:`DataFrame` are now property-style getters

- :meth:`nrow`, :meth:`ncol` for :class:`Array` 
  are now property-style getters

- static method :meth:`from_csvfile` and 
  instance method :meth:`to_csvfile` for :class:`DataFrame`

- module :mod:`lib` to store modules representing R packages

- module :mod:`lib.ggplot2` for the CRAN package ggplot2.

- renaming of few classes, the *R* prefix: :class:`Formula` (from *RFormula*),
  :class:`DataFrame` (from *RDataFrame*), :class:`Array` (from *RArray*),
  :class:`Matrix` (from *RMatrix*), :class:`Environment` (from *REnvironment*),
  :class:`Function` (from *RFunction*), :class:`Vector` (from *RVector*).

- :class:`robjects.vectors.Vector` lost the (now redundant) methods
  `subset` and `assign`. Those operations were just aliases to the 
  :class:`ExtractDelegator`

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- :data:`globalEnv`, :data:`baseNameSpaceEnv`, and :data:`emptyEnv` 
  were renamed to :data:`globalenv`, :data:`baseenv` and :data:`emptyenv`

  and a setter)

:mod:`rpy2.rpy_classic`:

- R named lists are returned as Python :class:`dict`, like rpy-1.x does it, with the
  notable difference that duplicate names are not silently overwritten: an exception
  of class :class:`ValueError` is thrown whenever happening


Bugs fixed
----------

- :meth:`REnvironment.get` now accepts a named parameter *wantFun*
  (like :meth:`rinterface.SexpEnvironment` does)

- :class:`rinterface.SexpVector` will now properly raise an exception
  when trying to create vector-like object of impossible type

- Crash when trying to create a SexpVector of a non-vector type

- R objects of class *matrix* are now properly converted into :class:`RMatrix`
  (instead of :class:`Array`)

Release 2.0.7
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- On win32, printing an object was leaving an open file handle behind each time,
  leading to an error and the impossibility to print
  (# bug report and fix by Christopher Gutierrez)

=============

No user-visible change. Win32-specific additions to the C module
were made to compile it.

----------

- Added missing named parameter *wantfun* to method :meth:`REnvironment.get`
  (making it similar to :meth:`SexpEnvironment.get`)

- Leak in reference counting when creating SexpVector objects fixed
  (the symptom was a process growing in size when creating R vector from
  Python list or numpy arrays)

- `R CMD config LAPACK_LIBS` could return an empty string when R was compiled
  with the veclib framework, causing the setup.py script to raise an exception.
  setup.py now only print a message about an empty string returned from 
  R CMD config

- Numpy arrays with complex elements are no longer causing segfaults

- Calls to :meth:`SexpClosure.rcall` with something else that the expected
  kind of tuple could cause a segfault


Release 2.0.3
=============

New Features
------------

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- :meth:`process_revents`, a Wrapper for R_ProcessEvents 
  (# suggested by June Kim to help with issues related to interactive display on win32),

- :meth:`Sexp.do_slot_assign` now creates the slot if missing
  (design-fix - # patch by Nathaniel Smith)
 

Bugs fixed
----------
 
- fixed problem of numpy interface with R boolean vectors. 
  They are now presented as 'i' rather than 'b' to numpy
  (# patch submitted by Nathaniel Smith)
 
- The mechanism for setting arbitrary callaback functions for console I/O 
  now ensures that a traceback is printed to stderr whenever an error
  occurs during the evalutation of the callback (the raised exception used
  to be silently propagated to the next python call, leading to problems).



Release 2.0.2
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Fix installation bug when the include directories contain either '-' or 'I'
  #spotted by James Yoo

- Failing to initialize R now throws a RuntimeError

- Copying an R "NA" into Python returns a None (and no longer a True)

- :func:`initEmbeddedR` renamed to :func:`initr`

- :func:`endEmbeddedR` renamed to :func:`endr`


:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- :class:`R` remains a singleton, but does not throw an exception when multiple instances are requested


Bugs fixed
----------

- indexing RVector the "R way" with subset is now possible through a delegating attribute (e.g., myvec.r[True] rather than myvec.subset(True)). #suggested by Michael Sorich

- new class :class:`RDataFrame`. The constructor :meth:`__init__` is still experimental (need for an ordered dictionnary, that will be in before the beta

- filled documentation about mapping between objects

Changes
-------

- many fixes and additions to the documentation

- improved GTK console in the demos

- changed the major version number to 2 in order to avoid confusion with rpy 1.x # Suggested by Peter and Gregory Warnes

- moved test.py to demos/example01.py

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- changed method name `getNames` to `getnames` where available (all lower-case names for methods seems to be the accepted norm in Python).


Bugs fixed
----------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- fixed string representation of R object on Microsoft Windows (using fifo, not available on win32)

- :meth:`__getattr__` for :class:`RS4` is now using :meth:`ri2py` 

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:
